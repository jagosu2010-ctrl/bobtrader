- **general** - General-purpose agent for multi-step tasks
- **frontend-ui-ux-engineer** - Designer-turned-developer for visual work
- **document-writer** - Technical writer for documentation
- **build** - Build specialist (manual invocation only)

---

## Universal Agent Guidelines

### 1. Agent Selection Strategy

**Choose Agent Based on Task:**

| Task Type | Best Agent | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Architecture decisions | oracle | Senior advisor, deep reasoning |
| Code exploration | explore | Fast, contextual search |
| External research | librarian | Specialized for external sources |
| Multi-step coordination | general | Orchestrates complex tasks |
| Visual/UI changes | frontend-ui-ux-engineer | Designer expertise |
| Documentation | document-writer | Technical writing specialist |
| Build issues | build | Build system specialist |

### 2. Task Delegation Principles

**When to Delegate:**
- Task requires specialized knowledge
- Task benefits from parallel execution
- Task is too complex for direct implementation
- Task requires external research
- Task has multiple independent sub-tasks

**When NOT to Delegate:**
- Simple one-line code changes
- Obvious syntax fixes
- Direct file reads/writes
- Simple git operations

### 3. Parallel Execution Strategy

**Launch Multiple Agents When:**
- Task has multiple independent research needs
- Task requires exploring multiple code areas
- Task needs both internal and external research
- Task can be broken into independent chunks

**Example Parallel Launch:**
```
background_task(agent="explore", prompt="Find auth implementations")
background_task(agent="explore", prompt="Find error handling patterns")
background_task(agent="librarian", prompt="Find JWT best practices")
```

### 4. Background Task Management

**Task Lifecycle:**
1. Launch with `background_task()`
2. Receive `task_id` immediately
3. Continue with other work
4. Use `background_output()` when results needed
5. `background_cancel(all=true)` when done

**Best Practices:**
- Don't wait for background tasks (non-blocking)
- Use `block=true` only when absolutely necessary
- Collect multiple results with multiple `background_output()` calls
- Always cancel background tasks before final answer

### 5. Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Structure:**
1. **TASK:** Atomic, specific goal (one action per delegation)
2. **EXPECTED OUTCOME:** Concrete deliverables with success criteria
3. **REQUIRED SKILLS:** Which skill to invoke (agent-specific)
4. **REQUIRED TOOLS:** Explicit tool whitelist (prevents tool sprawl)
5. **MUST DO:** Exhaustive requirements - leave NOTHING implicit
6. **MUST NOT DO:** Forbidden actions - anticipate and block rogue behavior
7. **CONTEXT:** File paths, existing patterns, constraints

**Example Good Prompt:**
```
1. TASK: Refactor notification system to reduce code duplication
2. EXPECTED OUTCOME: Base Notifier class with common methods, EmailNotifier/DiscordNotifier/TelegramNotifier extending base
3. REQUIRED SKILLS: python, refactoring, design patterns
4. REQUIRED TOOLS: read, edit, write, lsp
5. MUST DO: Extract common methods to base class while maintaining all functionality
6. MUST NOT DO: Change public APIs, break existing functionality
7. CONTEXT: Files in pt_notifications.py, existing patterns in codebase
```

**Example Bad Prompt:**
```
Fix the notification code.
```

**Bad Prompt Issues:**
- No specific goal
- No expected outcome
- No tools specified
- No context provided
- Too vague

## Agent Communication Best Practices

### 1. Providing Context

**Always Include:**
- Project structure overview
- Relevant file paths
- Existing patterns to follow
- Constraints and requirements
- What to avoid

**Example:**
```
Context: PowerTrader AI is a crypto trading bot with these modules:
- pt_hub.py: Main GUI (5835 lines)
- pt_thinker.py: Prediction AI (1381 lines)
- pt_trader.py: Trading engine (2421 lines)

Existing pattern: All exchange integrations use pt_exchanges.py ExchangeManager class with get_price() and get_candles() methods.
```

### 2. Setting Clear Expectations

**Specify:**
- What should be delivered
- Success criteria
- What should NOT be done
- Format of output
- Deadlines or constraints

### 3. Feedback Loop

**When Results Don't Match:**
- Provide specific feedback
- Explain what's missing
- Ask for corrections
- Relaunch with refined prompt

---

## Resource Management

### 1. Background Task Limits

**Best Practices:**
- Don't launch more than 5 parallel tasks
- Cancel tasks when no longer needed
- Collect results promptly
- Monitor task status

**Cleanup:**
- Always `background_cancel(all=true)` before final answer
- This conserves resources
- Ensures clean workflow completion

### 2. Tool Usage

**Tool Whitelist:**
- Specify allowed tools to prevent sprawl
- Only necessary tools for the task
- Prevents agent from using expensive tools

**Example:**
```
REQUIRED TOOLS: read, write, edit, lsp
// Not allowed: grep, glob, bash, websearch, webfetch
```

## Error Handling with Agents

### 1. Agent Failures

**When Agent Fails:**
1. Review the failure reason
2. Adjust prompt or choose different agent
3. Provide more specific context
4. Simplify task if needed
5. Try alternative approach

### 2. Partial Results

**When Results Are Incomplete:**
1. Use what's available
2. Request missing information specifically
3. Fill gaps with direct tools
4. Document what was vs. wasn't delivered

### 3. Quality Issues

**When Agent Quality is Low:**
1. Provide specific feedback
2. Ask for corrections
3. Use oracle agent to review work
4. Manually fix if necessary
